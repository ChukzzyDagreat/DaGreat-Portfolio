            I am particularly confident in my abilities with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the backbone of web development. I have a
            strong understanding of responsive design principles, ensuring that
            websites look and function well across various devices and screen
            sizes. Additionally, I am proficient in using frontend frameworks
            like React.js to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. My
            attention to detail and commitment to writing clean, maintainable
            code further enhance my confidence in delivering high-quality web
            applications.
